      <h1>XSLT 3.0 Test Results</h1>
      <p>Test results were submitted for the following processors:</p>
      <ol>
         <li>
            <p><b>Exselt</b> is...
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p><b>Parrot</b> is a pseudonym for a product produced by a company that is not a member of the Working
               Group and
               that has not participated actively in the development of the specification. The product
               is on general release; as such
               it should be regarded as an implementation of the 2015 Candidate Recommendation rather
               than the 2017 version. The test
               results were not submitted by the vendor, but were obtained by a member of the working
               group using a hastily-written
               test driver; as such, many of the test failures may be attributed either (a) to inadequacies
               in the test driver,
               or (b) to changes in the spec since 2015.

            <p><b>Saxon 9.8</b> is the forthcoming version of the commercial Saxon-EE/J product for the Java platform,
               produced by
               Saxonica. Tests were run on a development snapshot rather than a final quality release.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p><b>Saxon-JS</b> is an implementation of XSLT 3.0 written in Javascript designed to run in the browser,
               also from Saxonica. The product
               shares a front end with Saxon/J, but the back end (run-time) was developed independently
               from scratch. This is a first release
               of the product. Some of the test failures are unavoidable (for example, float arithmetic
               delivers double-precision results,
               which is deemed non-conformant), but others will be lifted in time especially as Javascript
               6 rolls out more completely
               across the browsers.

         <emph>Note: Except for the first row, this table omits all tests with multiple dependencies.
            For example a test that requires
            support for both streaming and schema awareness will appear in the "all" category,
            but not in either the streaming or
            schema awareness categories.
